Name:   R2D2
Desc:   A personal computing device in the cloud.

Question: How do we deliver cloud computing to everyone?

What?:  R2D2 promises to do to the cloud what Jobs did to Personal Computing.
        This is about making the cloud more available, more usable and more beautiful.
Why?:   The cloud has become synonymous with an ubiquitous storage service.
        But is that it?
        We wish to shift the focus of the cloud from storage to everyday computing.
        We want users to actually own cloud compute devices and install apps on it as easily as they use a smartphone.
Who?:   The everyday Internet consumer.
        People deserve more control, more privacy and unlimited freedom.
Where?: In the cloud and delivered:
        On your Pc.
        On your tablet.
        On your phone.
        To refridgerators.
        And Everywhere else.
When?:  Now.

How?:   By creating a massively scalable RESTful computing environment.
        Developers make apps using extremely powerful core APIs to run on high performance compute clusters.
        All this remains invisible to the user who uses these apps with the ease of a click.

Name:   Swan
Desc:   A fault-tolerant distributed social network that focuses on sharing things.

What?:  Swan aims to fix file sharing.
        Welcome to the age of social file-sharing.

        Artists. Photographers. Activists. And every other creative soul...

How?:   Git based disbrituted content sharing.
        Semi-desktop approach to leverage torrents.
        Users own their data. Everything is encrypted. Even what has been shared.

        Imagine planting trees becomes a gift on Facebook.
        Or feeding a hungry family in Botswana.
        Or gifting books to children in India and Myanmar.
